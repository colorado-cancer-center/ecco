## Background

Cancer Centers, including the University of Colorado Cancer Center, need to provide updated and reliable information to make informed decisions about how best to impact care in their catchment areas.
The code herein captures the disparate information available from public sources that can inform Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) activities.
The information can also help to generate hypotheses or produce valuable infographics about health disparities, particularly those with geographic relationships.

## Development

**This application is still a [work in progress](https://github.com/CU-DBMI/set-intake/issues/2).**

This repository contains Colorado-specific data, but its code/branding/etc. can be adapted to be used by any cancer center.

See [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for instructions on how to develop with the app.
