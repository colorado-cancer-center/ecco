    <p>
      Data for ECCO were gathered from several publicly available sources. Due
      to automated data collection efforts, years on sources will change over
      time. The years given here represent the most recently available data and
      reflect what is found on
      <AppLink to="https://cancerinfocus.org/"

      be updated as the most recent data becomes available.

    <AppHeading level="3">Suppressed Values</AppHeading>

    <p>
      In some cases, values may have been "suppressed", i.e. rounded down to 0
      or treated as "No Data". This is done to protect the privacy of
      individuals whose identities could be determined from the combination of a
      small value and a small population/geographic area. Depending on the data
      being viewed, the suppression was either already done in the original data
      source, or done in our pre-processing of the data. Thus, for a given
      feature on the map, it may be impossible to discriminate between a missing
      value, a true value of 0, and a very low value that was suppressed.

    <p>
      SCP is an interactive map engine produced in collaboration between the
      National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
      It was developed with the idea to provide a geographic profile of cancer
      burden in the United States and reveal geographic disparities in cancer
      incidence, mortality, risk factors for cancer, and cancer screening,
      across different population subgroups. The target audiences are health
      planners, policy makers, and cancer information providers who need quick
      and easy access to cancer related data and maps to inform and prioritize
      investments in cancer control.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cancer incidence data from SCP used in ECCO comes from the Surveillance,
      Epidemiology, and End Results SEER*Stat Database and from the National
      Program of Cancer Registries where applicable. The most recently available
      incidence data are the 5-year average age-adjusted rates per 100,000
      people for 2016-2020.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cancer mortality data from SCP used in ECCO comes from the National Vital
      Statistics System public use data file. The most recently available
      mortality data are the 5-year age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000
      people for 2016-2020.

      The BLS measures labor market activity, working conditions, price changes,

      (not seasonally adjusted). This data is updated monthly and typically runs

      PLACES is a collaboration between CDC, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
      and the CDC Foundation. PLACES provides health data for small areas across
      the country. This allows local health departments and jurisdictions,
      regardless of population size and rurality, to better understand the
      burden and geographic distribution of health measures in their areas and
      assist them in planning public health interventions.
    </p>

    <p>
      PLACES provides model-based, population-level analysis and community
      estimates of health measures to all counties, places (incorporated and
      census designated places), census tracts, and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas
      (ZCTAs) across the United States.

      HRSA programs provide health care to people who are geographically
      isolated, economically or medically vulnerable. This includes people
      living with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women, mothers and their families, and
      those otherwise unable to access high quality health care. HRSA also
      supports access to health care in rural areas, the training of health
      professionals, the distribution of providers to areas where they are
      needed most, and improvements in health care delivery.

      ECCO uses facility data for Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHC),
      FQHC Look-a-Likes (FQHC LAL), Rural Health Clinics (RHC), and Correctional

    <p>
      The ACR Lung Cancer Screening Registry (LCSR) is designed to
      systematically audit the quality of interpretation of screening lung CT
      exams. The registry is based on the ACR Lung Imaging Reporting and Data
      System (Lung-RADS), which is the product of the ACR Lung Cancer Screening
      Committee subgroup on Lung-RADS. This Lung-RADS system is a quality
      assurance tool designed to standardize lung cancer screening CT reporting
      and management recommendations, reduce confusion in lung cancer screening
      CT interpretations and facilitate outcome monitoring. The ACR LCSR will
      capture Lung-RADS recommendations and monitor and compare appropriate use
      of Lung-RADS

      ECCO uses the location data for Lung Cancer Screening Sites from the LCSR.

        Note: Not all lung cancer screening sites are required to be a part of

      The Mammography Quality Standards Act requires mammography facilities
      across the nation to meet uniform quality standards. Congress passed this
      law in 1992 to assure high-quality mammography for early breast cancer
      detection, which can lead to early treatment, a range of treatment
      options, and increased chances of survival. Under the law, all mammography
      facilities must: 1) be accredited by an FDA-approved accreditation body,
      2) be certified by FDA, or its State, as meeting the standards, 3) undergo
      an annual MQSA inspection, and 4) prominently display the certificate
      issued by the agency.

    <p>
      ECCO uses the location data for Mammography Sites from the FDA Certified
      Mammography Facilities list. This data is updated on a weekly basis to

    <AppHeading level="3">Cancer Disparities Index</AppHeading>

    <p>
      Burden data were used to rank every county using the cancer disparities
      index. Rankings are based on incidence, late-stage incidence, and
      mortality data provided by the Colorado Central Cancer Registry and Vital
      Statistics from CDPHE. Data are unavailable for some counties due to
      confidentiality or statistics reliability concerns.
    </p>

    <p>
      To develop the index, a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was applied to
      the most recent burden data. PCA is a process used to detect the strongest
      patterns in a data set and to emphasize variation. Unlike other
      statistical methods, PCA makes very few assumptions about data. It is
      commonly used for data exploration and health index creation. PCA
      determines which variables summarize the overall data best and packages
      these variables that are most alike into new variables or “components”.
      Each of these new variables are given a weight based on how much of the
      overall data variation they explain and an index score is calculated. A
      higher disease disparity index (i.e., higher rank) will have a higher
      corresponding index score applied to the application.

    <p>
      Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in the
      environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and
      age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality of life
      outcomes and risks. SDOH can be grouped into 5 domains: economic
      stability; education access and quality; health care access and quality;
      neighborhood and built environment; and social and community context. It
      has been shown that social determinants of health can affect lifestyle and
      therefore chronic diseases, including cancer.
