The EPA's Envirofacts Multisystem Search integrates information from a variety of databases and includes latitude and longitude information.
Each of these databases contains information about facilities that are required to report activity to a state or federal system.

ECCO draws information on Superfund sites from the [Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS)](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sems-overview) and information on facilities releasing known carcinogens from the [Toxic Release Inventory](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/tri-model).
