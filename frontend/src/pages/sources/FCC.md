The FCC regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.
An independent U.S. government agency overseen by Congress, the Commission is the federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing America’s communications law and regulations.

ECCO uses the FCC Form 477 broadband data on average maximum advertised upload and download speeds at the Census block group level.
This data is updated twice yearly in June and December and runs about one year behind.
