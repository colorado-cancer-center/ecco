SCP is an interactive map engine produced in collaboration between the National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It was developed with the idea to provide a geographic profile of cancer burden in the United States and reveal geographic disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, risk factors for cancer, and cancer screening, across different population subgroups.
The target audiences are health planners, policy makers, and cancer information providers who need quick and easy access to cancer related data and maps to inform and prioritize investments in cancer control.

ECCO uses SCP cancer incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results SEER\*Stat Database and from the National Program of Cancer Registries where applicable.

ECCO uses SCP cancer mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System public use data file.
