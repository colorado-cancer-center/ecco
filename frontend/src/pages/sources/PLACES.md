PLACES is a collaboration between CDC, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the CDC Foundation that provides health data for small areas across the country, allowing local health departments and jurisdictions -- regardless of population size and rurality -- to better understand the burden and geographic distribution of health measures in their areas and assist them in planning public health interventions.

PLACES provides model-based, population-level analyses and community estimates of health measures to all counties, incorporated and census designated places, census tracts, and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) across the U.S.

ECCO uses the following indicators from PLACES, which are based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
