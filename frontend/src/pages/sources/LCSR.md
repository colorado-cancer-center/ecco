The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (LCSR) is designed to systematically audit the quality of interpretation of screening lung CT exams.
The registry is based on the ACR Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS), which is the product of the ACR Lung Cancer Screening Committee subgroup on Lung-RADS.
This Lung-RADS system is a quality assurance tool designed to standardize lung cancer screening CT reporting and management recommendations, reduce confusion in lung cancer screening CT interpretations and facilitate outcome monitoring.
The ACR LCSR will capture Lung-RADS recommendations and monitor and compare appropriate use of Lung-RADS

ECCO uses the location data for Lung Cancer Screening Sites from the LCSR.
This data is available in real-time, reflecting active lung cancer screening locations in the LCSR.

_Note: Not all lung cancer screening sites are required to be a part of the LCSR._
_The ACR estimates that the LCSR reflects between 80%-90% of all active sites in the nation._
