The mission of USDA’s Economic Research Service is to anticipate trends and emerging issues in agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America and to conduct high-quality, objective economic research to inform and enhance public and private decision making.
ERS research and analysis covers a broad range of economic and policy topics including food/nutrition and poverty.

ECCO uses the indicator Food Deserts (LILA Vehicle) from the ERS.
