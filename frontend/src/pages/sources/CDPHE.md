The CDPHE provides communities in Colorado with relevant, accurate and accessible web-based data on environmental health hazards and related health effects.

ECCO uses [CDPHE's radon dataset](https://coepht.colorado.gov/radon-dataset-details) to provide various measures of indoor household radon levels via mostly self-administered tests.

ECCO uses [CDPHE's teen HPV immunization dataset](https://cohealthviz.dphe.state.co.us/t/DCEED_Public/views/CountyRateMaps-Storyboard/CountyRateMapsCombined), which comes from the Colorado Immunization Information System (CIIS), a system for estimating immunization uptake and tracking vaccination coverage levels over time.
