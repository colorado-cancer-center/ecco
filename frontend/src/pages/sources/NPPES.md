Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services CMS has developed the NPPES to assign unique identifiers to health care providers.
The National Provider Indentifier (NPI) has been the standard identifier for all HIPAA-covered entities (health care providers) since May 23, 2007.
Small health plans were required to obtain and use an NPI by May 23, 2008.

ECCO uses the location data for gastroenterologists and colon & rectal surgeons from the NPPES.
This data is available in real-time, reflecting all practicing providers.
