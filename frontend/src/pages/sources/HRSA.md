HRSA programs in the Department of Health & Human Services provide health care to people who are geographically isolated, economically or medically vulnerable.
This includes people living with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women, mothers and their families, and those otherwise unable to access high quality health care.
HRSA also supports access to health care in rural areas, the training of health professionals, the distribution of providers to areas where they are needed most, and improvements in health care delivery.

ECCO uses facility data for Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), FQHC Look-a-Likes (FQHC LAL), Rural Health Clinics (RHC), and Correctional Facility clinics.
All of these facilities fall under the general classification of Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) facilities.
This data is available in real-time, reflecting all such facilities currently recognized by HRSA.
