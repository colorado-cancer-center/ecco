The Mammography Quality Standards Act requires mammography facilities across the nation to meet uniform quality standards.
Congress passed this law in 1992 to assure high-quality mammography for early breast cancer detection, which can lead to early treatment, a range of treatment options, and increased chances of survival.
Under the law, all mammography facilities must: 1) be accredited by an FDA-approved accreditation body, 2) be certified by FDA, or its State, as meeting the standards, 3) undergo an annual MQSA inspection, and 4) prominently display the certificate issued by the agency.

ECCO uses the location data for Mammography Sites from the FDA Certified Mammography Facilities list.
