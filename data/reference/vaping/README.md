# Youth and Adult Vaping Data

The youth vaping data is sourced from the [Healthy Kids Colorado Survey
(HKCS)](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/healthy-kids-colorado-survey)
conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE).
The HKCS provides insights into the prevalence of vaping among middle and high
school students in Colorado. The data includes information on the percentage of
students who have ever used e-cigarettes, current use, and perceptions of harm
associated with vaping.

The adult vaping data is sourced from the [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) conducted by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The BRFSS collects data on
health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive
services among adults in the United States. The vaping-related data includes
information on the percentage of adults who have ever used e-cigarettes and
current use.

Vaping statistics are aggregated at the Health Statistics Region (HSR) level,
which are defined by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
(CDPHE). HSRs are groupings of counties that share similar health
characteristics and are used for public health planning and analysis.

The files that are actuallly ingested into the database are the following:
- **Adult Vaping Data (HSR level):**
  `data/reference/vaping/sheets/adult/ECCO_ECIGREQUEST_BRFSS23_HSRSTATS.xlsx`
- **Youth Vaping Data (State and HSR level):**
  `data/reference/vaping/youth_vaping_now.csv`

The other files are not currently used, but have been kept in case we do want to
use them in the future.
